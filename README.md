# Weather App - work assignment

You can see a working demo [here](https://weather-43510.web.app/).

## notes
- The app was tested only on Chrome.
- The hole assigment took me around 20 hours.
- If you reach the API limit you:
  - Switch to demo data by clicking the link on the top right corner (desktop only).
  - Update the API_KEY in key.tsx
- The design was inspired by [Jon Keeping's post](https://medium.com/@JonUK/designing-and-developing-a-responsive-weather-app-webpage-part-1-b155b004a5ba).
- the Icons were taken from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and [UIFresh](https://uifresh.net/product/weather-icons/)
